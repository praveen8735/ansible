# Ansible Projects [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/resmo/ansible-role-ntp.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/praveen8735/ansible)

Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy. Avoid writing scripts or custom code to deploy and update your applications â€” automate in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems.
